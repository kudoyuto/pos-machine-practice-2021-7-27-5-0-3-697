|locateItemDetails|10mins|1hr 55 mins|I was trying to convert it to array since I am still not familiar with List. After creating those arrays I just found out that I cannot modify the array itself in Java. So I am reading more about List and after trying, still can't display anything.|Try to read more about Java and familiarize myself to List and many methods that are required to finish this task.|
| |- | -| - |Changed my context map reference to Jeany's context map. below is the new PDCA.
|loadAllItemsInfo|5 mins | 3m 49s | I did some research and trying to code for hours for 1 function and I got this output. So tried with a new function.| Still need to familiarize myself to use List.
|covertToItems|6 m|11m 34s|I was reviewing my code and how some methods and List works. I am still trying to explore it.| Searched about stream API to implement it.
|calculateSubTotal|7 m|5m 38s|I finished it before the time because the implementation is not that long and hard.|I need to familiarize my self about foreach and List.
|calculateTotal|5m|4m 44s|I finished it before the P because the implementation is also short.| I just used the return receipt rather than int for total price since that is the return requirement in context map.
